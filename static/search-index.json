OTP signup: username is provided during verification. OAuth signup: if user is new, Structra auto generates a unique username. Login Flows Users can sign in with either email or username. If identifier contains , login resolves as email. Otherwise, login resolves as username. Profile Editing Users can edit profile metadata including username. Username updates are checked for global uniqueness before save. If taken, a validation error is returned and save is blocked. Search and Privacy User search runs through trigram similarity for fast partial matching. Search excludes the current authenticated user.

Evidence Expectations Architecture diagram or component inventory Datastore and message flow definitions Throughput and growth assumptions Failure mode and recovery strategy Security and observability controls Tier Progression Free : Fundamental production hygiene checks Pro : Distributed systems and scale pattern checks Enterprise : Strict large scale architecture constraints Everyone can read all docs.

    "title": "Production System Design Principles",
    "url": "/evaluation-principles/production-system-principles",
    "text": "Production System Design Principles These principles are for high stakes production architecture reviews. They focus on failure containment, correctness under concurrency, and operational survivability at scale. PRD 01: End to End Deadline Propagation Every inbound request must carry a deadline budget propagated across all downstream calls. Local service timeouts without inherited deadlines create request amplification and tail latency collapse. PRD 02: Timeout Hierarchy Must Be Monotonic Client timeout must be greater than gateway timeout, which must be greater than service timeout, which must be greater than datastore timeout. Non monotonic timeout trees cause retry storms and duplicate work. PRD 03: Backpressure Is Mandatory on Every Queue Boundary Producers must respond to consumer lag using bounded queues, adaptive throttling, and explicit shed policies. Unbounded buffers hide overload until catastrophic memory or latency failure. PRD 04: Load Shedding Before Saturation Services must reject low priority traffic before CPU, connection pools, or thread pools saturate. Controlled rejection preserves core paths and prevents full cluster brownouts. PRD 05: Bulkheads for Dependency Isolation Each critical dependency requires isolated worker pools, connection pools, and circuit breaker state. Shared pools allow one failing dependency to collapse unrelated flows. PRD 06: Control Plane and Data Plane Separation Configuration, orchestration, and policy updates must be isolated from request serving execution paths. Control plane instability must never halt data plane serving. PRD 07: Cell Based Isolation for Tenant Blast Radius Large multi tenant systems must partition tenants into cells with isolated compute and data boundaries. A single noisy or broken tenant must not degrade global SLO. PRD 08: Hot Partition Detection and Shard Rebalancing Partition strategies must include continuous skew detection and live rebalancing mechanisms. Static keys without skew management eventually create irreversible hot shards. PRD 09: Schema Evolution Requires Compatibility Guarantees Message and API schema changes must maintain explicit backward/forward compatibility windows with contract tests. Non versioned schema changes are distributed outage vectors. PRD 10: Online Data Migration Without Write Freeze Large migrations require phased rollout: dual read or shadow read validation, chunked backfills, and cutover guarded by parity metrics. Big bang migration windows are operationally unsafe. PRD 11: Outbox + Idempotent Consumer for Cross System Consistency State change events must be emitted through transactional outbox, and downstream consumers must dedupe by idempotency key. Dual write without outbox is eventual data divergence. PRD 12: Exactly Once Delivery Must Not Be Assumed Distributed messaging must be designed for at least once semantics with deterministic deduplication. Claims of exactly once correctness without end to end proof are invalid. PRD 13: Multi Region Strategy Includes Conflict Semantics Multi region write paths must define conflict resolution policy (last writer wins, CRDT, domain specific merge, or hard ownership). Replication without conflict semantics is correctness debt. PRD 14: Dependency Budgeting and Criticality Tiers Every external dependency must have an assigned criticality tier with explicit fallback mode and allowed error budget consumption. Unclassified dependencies make incident response non deterministic. PRD 15: SLO Error Budget Governs Release Velocity Release gates must be tied to error budget burn, not calendar cadence. Shipping while budget is exhausted converts reliability debt into recurring incidents. PRD 16: Alerting Must Map to User Visible Impact Alerts should be derived from golden signals and SLO burn rates, with runbook links and owner routing attached. Metric threshold only alerting creates noisy, low action pages. PRD 17: Capacity Model Includes Saturation Forecasting Capacity planning must model "

Define Architecture Inputs Provide clear input data before evaluating: Traffic expectations (current and projected) Read/write characteristics Availability target (SLO) Data consistency needs Known failure scenarios 3. Run Evaluation Start evaluation from your workspace. Review failed and warning checks. Open each finding to see why the rule triggered. 4. Remediate and Re run Prioritize critical reliability and data integrity findings first. Apply architecture fixes. Re run evaluation after each major design change. Common Mistakes Missing cache strategy for read heavy systems No DLQ/retry policy for async processing Undefined idempotency on critical write endpoints Missing failover strategy for single points of failure"
